# blockchain-raspberry-pi

## What
This is the course project for the subject Blockchain and Cryprocurrency in the 6th semester of IIIT Allahabad. Hence, we have implemented how blockchain can be used to store information of IoT devices, specifically the status of GPIO Pins (on / off) in a Raspberry Pi, and temperature readings from thermal sensor emulator.

## Why
With a horde of IoT devices proliferating the day-to-day lives of people around the world, these devices often lack the authentication standards necessary to keep user data safe. Critical infrastructure will be damaged if hackers penetrate through these devices. Therefore, in order to ensure trust, authentication, and standardization across all elements of IoT, blockchain can be used.
